A user session period corresponds to the period of time the user is logged in Teampass before being automatically logged out. Once time session is over, the active session of the user is closed.
The remaining time (count down) is visible in the footer.

One minute before expiration, a warning message is displayed to the user asking him to renew the session period.
A user can also increment the session at any moment using `Extend session by 1 hour` in the top menu bar.

This field requires a numerical value in **minutes**. Its default value is 60 minutes (1 hour).
